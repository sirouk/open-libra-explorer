This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Configuration

This explorer supports both client-side and server-side API calls to the blockchain. You can configure this behavior in the `config.ts` file:

```typescript
// When true, API calls will be made directly from the browser
// When false, API calls will be made server-side using server actions
export const CLIENT_SIDE_API = true;
```

Setting `CLIENT_SIDE_API` to `true` makes all blockchain queries run directly in the browser, which can be useful for development or when you want to reduce server load. Setting it to `false` uses Next.js server actions for all API calls, which can be more secure and performant for production use.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
